Work in progress. Minimally functional right now for touch and keyboard.
<br><br>
The idea was to create a modeler that makes copy pastable code for coding projects(three.js / javascript) Maybe also complete html pages showing the work you made in the editor(bare bones).
<br>
touch - (multi)select / move canvas / activate view.<br>
keyboard instructions on the screen.<br>
add modify move vertices and uvs.<br>
