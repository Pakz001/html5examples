trying to figure out the things needed to code a voxel minecraft type game.

boxes, chunks, atlasses, worlds, collision, controls, ...

(buildup using same template)
book1 = plane cube camera spotlight
book2 = plane cube shadow rotation
book3 = plane cube spotlight rotation fog shadow
book4 = create a mesh from points.
