trying to figure out the things needed to code a voxel minecraft type game.<br>

boxes, chunks, atlasses, worlds, collision, controls, ...<br>
<br>
(buildup using same template)<br>
book1 = plane cube camera spotlight<br>
book2 = plane cube shadow rotation<br>
book3 = plane cube spotlight rotation fog shadow<br>
book4 = create a mesh from points.<br>
book5 = group 2 cubes, each cube of different color.<br>
