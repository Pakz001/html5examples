from the online three.js model scene editor(free!)<br><br>

exports models and scenes as json. and lots of formats too.<br><br>

I can create game models from multiple shapes in the editor and export these as scenes. these are json format. a scene 
is a collection of the models in the editor. these can be rotated as a entire blob. animating needs research. loading these is shown in the
book36.html example.<br>
