Javascript can use all cores on a cpu. I'm trying to learn how to do that now that I<br>
found out that this is possible with a ipados development app.<br>
<br>
Im trying to dissect examples and understand documentation. My innitial goal is<br>
to have my THREE.js Voxel game use workers to create chunks. My ipad has 8 cores so<br>
the speed increase should be great.<br>
<br>
this folder here wil hold examples and experiments.<br><br>
