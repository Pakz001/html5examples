Genetic algorithm to copy a input canvas of 32 by 32 to a line script. This by comparing a population of lines 
to the original and doing (smart)adjustements.<br>
The output is supposed to be turned into a regular function that draws the character using regular lineto commands. No font needed.<br><br>

I had the idea this might be fun to run on a old low powered cpu. Sort of like fishing for code that draws stuff..<br><br>
