Genetic algorithm to copy a input canvas of 32 by 32 to a line script. This by comparing a population of lines 
to the original and doing (smart)adjustements.<br>
The output is supposed to be turned into a regular function that draws the character using regular lineto commands. No font needed.<br><br>

I had the idea this might be fun to run on a old low powered cpu. Sort of like fishing for code that draws stuff..<br><br>

Extracting or finding algorithms from the workings of Genetic Algorithms<br>
While programming now. I realize this method of using a genetic algorithm is a sure way into developing the techniques to do a specific task fast. While tweaking and studying the way it works. New ideas seem to come into my mind. Speeding things up and discovering techniques to do it really fast. Things that went random before now seem to turn into a more algorithmic system.
