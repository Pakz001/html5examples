Version 11. : This morning it was stuck at little letter 'o'. At 45.000.000 passes. 8 hours or so passed to get to 'o'. I should be able to let it run a night using a new mini pc with 4x the cpu power tonight. I will try and run the little 'o' a couple of times on the 4500u and see if there is a problem there.

Made to experiment with Genetic algorithms and having some time testing out a old celeron cpu for automation.<br><br>
Output is script parts with line drawing instructions that recreate inputted font characters hopefully in a stylish way. May look a bit similar to inexperienced people trying to draw alphabet characters. Might be used to create lots of character sketch data. The font types can be changed to recreate a whole library of data statements with lines that recreate characters.

Genetic algorithm to copy a input canvas of 32 by 32 to a line script. This by comparing a population of lines 
to the original and doing (smart)adjustements.<br>
The output is supposed to be turned into a regular function that draws the character using regular lineto commands. No font needed.<br><br>

I had the idea this might be fun to run on a old low powered cpu. Sort of like fishing for code that draws stuff..<br><br>

Extracting or finding algorithms from the workings of Genetic Algorithms<br><br>
While programming now. I realize this method of using a genetic algorithm is a sure way into developing the techniques to do a specific task fast. While tweaking and studying the way it works. New ideas seem to come into my mind. Speeding things up and discovering techniques to do it really fast. Things that went random before now seem to turn into a more algorithmic system.

Ideas:<br><br>
+grid array compare, compare two arrays in a grid comparisment method. Divide the array into say 16 cells. 4 by 4. Calculate the score based on the similarities of each of those cells.
