Idea for redballeffect.<br><br>
If the 3d cross were turned into a painting brush it might be useful to draw shapes as planets and suns and other kind of things.<br><br>
multiple brushes that go into a x,y,z globe direction with the direction of the mouse or touch device.<br>
It might also just serve as a generator for shapes.<br>
