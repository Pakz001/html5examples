<br>
Conversion project from my Monkey 2 game 'Mine Slime and Monsters'..
<br>
When it gets around 5000 lines it should be close to converted.
<br>
<br>
I was planning on creating (more)gfx for the game and adding features and cleaning it up a bit..

**Ideas :**
* Replay - When you die the last few seconds are replayed showing how you died(zoomed in)
* Scientist say matter can form out of nothingness. Taking this a notch further, "the spawning of devil eggs".
* infinite sized maps? (Keep mining - save/load chunks)
* Shops to sell loot and buy loads of ammo and guns and equipment.
* Radio controlled drones. Machine gun drone and Explosive drone and flame thrower drone.
* flame thrower..
* Talk to villagers.
* rescue villagers (mission?)
* Lighting system?
* Ladder rider - tool for going up and down ladders faster (store:levels)

<br><br>
**Adding Features later on :**
* Controller(xbox)
* Touch screen controls(touch the screen and it displays a sliding menu to activate touch controls.)
