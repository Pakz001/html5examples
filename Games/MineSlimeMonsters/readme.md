    // When it gets around 5000 lines it should be close to converted.

    <br>
    Conversion :<br>
    * Added new controller code system. Should make joypad and touch control easier.
    * ..
    
    Ideas :<br>
    * Scientist say matter can form out of nothingness. Taking this a notch further, "the spawning of devil eggs".
    * infinite maps?
    * Shops to sell loot and buy loads of ammo and guns and equipment.
    * Radio controlled drones. Machine gun drone and Explosive drone and flame thrower drone.
    * flame thrower..
    * Talk to villagers.
    * rescue villagers (mission?)
    * Lighting system?
