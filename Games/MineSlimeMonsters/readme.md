Conversion project from my Monkey 2 game 'Mine Slime and Monsters'..
<br>
When it gets around 5000 lines it should be close to converted.
<br>
<br>
I was planning on creating (more)gfx for the game and adding features and cleaning it up a bit..

<b>Conversion :</b>
* Added new controller code system. Should make joypad and touch control easier.
* Figure out what to do with resolution / window size changes.(pauze/rebuild?)

 <br><br>
<b>Ideas :</b>
* Scientist say matter can form out of nothingness. Taking this a notch further, "the spawning of devil eggs".
* infinite maps?
* Shops to sell loot and buy loads of ammo and guns and equipment.
* Radio controlled drones. Machine gun drone and Explosive drone and flame thrower drone.
* flame thrower..
* Talk to villagers.
* rescue villagers (mission?)
* Lighting system?

<br><br>
<b>Adding Features :</b>
* Controller(xbox)
* Touch screen controls(touch screen and display sliding menu to activate touch controls)
