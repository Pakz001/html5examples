**Ideas :**
* Replay - When you die the last few seconds are replayed showing how you died(zoomed in)
* Scientist say matter can form out of nothingness. Taking this a notch further, "the spawning of devil eggs".
* infinite sized maps? (Keep mining - save/load chunks)
* Shops to sell loot and buy loads of ammo and guns and equipment.
* Radio controlled drones. Machine gun drone and Explosive drone and flame thrower drone.
* flame thrower..
* Talk to villagers.
* rescue villagers (mission?)
* Lighting system?
* Ladder rider - tool for going up and down ladders faster (store:levels)
* tile (globalAlpha) light fill around play to add some mood and eye candy

<br><br>
**Adding Features later on/bugs :**
* Touch screen controls(touch the screen and it displays a sliding menu to activate touch controls.)
* Fix up slime tiles. Bottom floor is unused. player can go through slime(?) Round edges(auto tiling)
* Create start position at slime location.
* Copy selected map from selection to game (new map)
* Walker ai walks backwards sometimes
