Populous was a video game from 1989 by Bullfrog productions, ltd. A real time isometric strategy game. <br>
It was released for a whole series of home computers. The Commodore Amiga being one of them.<br><br>
The map in the game was quite special. I never programmed something like this before. I'm trying to get a map engine going right.<br><br>
In this folder is a source file that has 16 tiles that I remade using the build in polygon drawing commands in javascript.<br><br>
I hope to figure out how this isometric map with different heights works.<br><br>
I'm programming it right now on a Ipad and Iphone. There are no mouse and keyboard controls at the moment. I can add this later when I am testing and using the laptop. Feel fee to study my repo for bits and pieces that can be inserted into this project for more features(like mouse and keyboard controls)<br>
