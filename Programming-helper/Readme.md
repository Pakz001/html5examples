From the Artificial Intelligence website : <a href="https://www.programming-helper.com/">Programming-helper.com</a><br><br>

The site allows you to generate short, up to 1000 characters, pieces of code. You ask it for say "rectsoverlap" or any other 
description of code that should do X<br>
In the future this kind of systems wil become more used I imagine. Learning how to use this is something I started doing now<br><br>

I did not store the prompts. They are sometimes written in the code. These were the comments in the code.<br><br>
