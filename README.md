<h3>html5 javascript game oriented example code. ( Learn to code games by studying examples ) </h3><br><br>

the voxel engine is in folder 3d/threetest/test/<br><br>

update:<br>
I decided to start using a Windows laptop again after a time of only using a iPad. I discovered the free Visual Studio in the microsoft store.<br>
I wil start to slowly add keyboard controls to older things. My laptop has touch screen too.<br>
<br>
I might get a bit distracted with pygame as this was a breeze to install.<br><br>
I was working on a platformer game project a number of years ago. This might get ported to Javascript. It is around 5000 lines in the Monkey2 language.<br>
I am drawing gfx (including animations) for it now.<br>
(old browser version / emscripten / keyboard only)<br>

Copy paste (edit) and run. ( each html file is stand alone and requires no clunky installing. just open it with a browser )
(three.js requires more work. media and .js includes and later worker threading files (3d))
