prototypes, samples, experiments of a 2d pixel editing tool(sprite editor paint tool)
<br><br>
trying to create and learn to create specialized paint brushes.<br>
initial idea, create a pixel art brush that has height. angle/edge/higlight/shade/move speed/slow add details.<br>
<br><br>
notes:<br>
figure out smear logic.
<br>
Ideas:<br>
Blob brushes - Use shapes other than round and square - generate a random* single blob of x,y size. The edges are read as a array for the brush logic to use.<br>
pixel art tree/bush brush. Draw from the center out. reference: down black edges and darker inside. Up lighter edges and slightly darker smudge(leaf). angle ui / color range ui. / detailing level ui.<br>
a brush where edges up and down are shaded. left and right are lighter and darker. (find reference<br>
