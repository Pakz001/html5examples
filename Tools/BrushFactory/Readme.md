prototypes, samples, experiments of a 2d pixel editing tool(sprite editor paint tool)
<br><br>
trying to create and learn to create specialized paint brushes.<br>
initial idea, create a pixel art brush that has height. angle/edge/higlight/shade/move speed/slow add details.<br>
<br><br>
notes:<br>Ideas:<br>
Blob brushes - Use shapes other than round and square - generate a random* single blob of x,y size. The edges are read as a array for the brush logic to use.<br>
